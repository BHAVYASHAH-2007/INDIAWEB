        The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ -/ TAHJ mə-HAHL, TAHZH -⁠; Hindustani: [taːdʒ ˈmɛɦ(ɛ)l]; lit. 'Crown of
        the Palace') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh,
        India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of
        his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a
        17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on
        three sides by a crenellated wall.

        Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for
        another five years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February
        1643, of the 12th anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
        completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2015 would
        be approximately ₹52.8 billion (US$827 million).

        The building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs
        symmetrical constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of
        white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar
        to the Mughal era buildings of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans
        under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect.
