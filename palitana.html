            Palitana is a city in the Bhavnagar district of the Indian state of Gujarat. It is one of the most
            significant pilgrimage destinations for followers of Jainism, renowned for the Shatrunjaya hill temples, a
            sprawling complex of over 900 marble temples considered among the holiest in Jainism. In 2014, Palitana
            became the first city in the world to be officially declared vegetarian, prohibiting the sale of meat, fish,
            and eggs, in alignment with its strong Jain ethical values. Located approximately 50 kilometres
            southwest of Bhavnagar, the city was historically a princely state during British rule.

            Palitana is the world's only mountain that has more than 900 temples. The Palitana temples and whole
            mountain are considered the most sacred pilgrimage place (tirtha) by the Jain community, and is the world's
            largest Temple Complex. There are more than 3000 temples located on the Shatrunjaya hills, exquisitely
            carved in marble. The main temple on top of the hill, is dedicated to the first Tirthankara Rishabhanatha
            (Rishabhadeva). The temples were built by generations of Jains over a period of 900 years, from the 11th
            century onwards. The temples are managed by the Anandji Kalyanji Trust associated with the Kasturbhai
            Lalbhai group. From the foot of the hill to the top there are about 3,800 stone steps to facilitate
            climbing.
