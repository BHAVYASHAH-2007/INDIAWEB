            According to Jain texts, Mahavira was born on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the moon in the month
            of Chaitra in the year 599 BC.According to Shvetambara tradition, he was born in
            Kshatriyakund of Bihar. Some modern historians consider Kundagram (which is today's Kundalpur in Muzaffarpur
            district of Bihar) as his birthplace. He was born in a democratic kingdom (Ganarajya), Vajji, where the king
            was chosen by votes.
