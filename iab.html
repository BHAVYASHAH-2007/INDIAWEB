        The Iranshah Atash Behram, also known as the Udwada Atash Behram, is a sacred fire housed in a temple in
        Udvada, Valsad district, Gujarat on the west coast of India. The Atash Bahram, meaning "Victorious Fire", is
        the oldest fire temple in India, dated to the eighth century, and represents the historical cultural and
        religious links with Iran. The current temple housing the sacred fire was built in 1742 by Motlibai Wadia
        from Bombay. The temple structure, built spaciously, is well decorated and contains the Dasturji Kaiyoji
        Mirza hall and a museum. The main hall of the temple is accessed through a two-stage staircase. The temple
        attracts Zoroastrian pilgrims from all parts of India, Pakistan, and from around the world.

        Zoroastrian religion; one of the eight in India. It is located in Udvada (also spelled Udwada) in Valsad
