            Holi is a major Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours, Love and
            Spring. It celebrates the eternal and divine love of the deities Radha and Krishna.
            Additionally, the day signifies the triumph of good over evil,as it commemorates the victory of Vishnu
            as Narasimha over Hiranyakashipu. Holi originated and is predominantly celebrated in the Indian
            subcontinent, but has also spread to other regions of Asia and parts of the Western world through the Indian
            diaspora.
