        The Jama Masjid (Hindi: जामा मस्जिद) is a Sunni Friday mosque, located in the Kalbadevi neighbourhood, near
        Crawford Market in the South Mumbai region of Mumbai, in the state of Maharashtra, India. The mosque was
        completed in stages during the 19th century, in the Indo-Islamic style.

        The Muslim community of Mumbai possesses 89 mosques, of which eight are affiliated with the Bohra tradition,
        two with the Khoja tradition, one with the Mughals, and the remaining with the Sunni tradition.

        The construction started in 1775 with raising of foundations on the tank. Objections were raised by
        neighbours that delayed construction until 1778. More disputes arose with illegal construction activities to
        its west and south. Finally the Governor of Bombay, Sir Meadows Taylor, decided in favour of the mosque
        authorities. The mosque was completed in 1217 AH (1802/1803 CE), as derived from the chronogram Jahaz-i-
        Akhirat, "The ship of the world to come", which contains an allusion to the fact that it was constructed on
        the tank.
