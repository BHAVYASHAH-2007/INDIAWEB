        The recorded history of Amaravati and nearby Dharanikota dates back to the 5th century BC. Amaravati was the
        capital of Satavahanas, who ruled from the 3rd century BC to the 3rd century AD. The Satavahanas were notable
        for their patronage of both Buddhism and Hinduism. The most important historic monument in Amaravathi is the
        Mahachaitya, which is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and has a site museum known as the old
        museum.

        The Dhyana Buddha project was conceived by R. Mallikarjuna Rao in 2002, who was then the Deputy Director of the
        Social Welfare Department in Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh. Inspired by the magnificence of the Amaravati
        School of Art, which flourished in the region circa 200 BC – 200 AD and wanted to recreate it. The Guntur
        district administration provided 4.5 acre of land for the project, and construction began in 2003–04. The funds
        for the project were provided by the Andhra Pradesh state government, Guntur district administration, Dalai
        Lama, Tourism Department, Kalachakra organisers Norbulingka, and also from the sale of greeting cards and
        paintings done by Mallikarjuna Rao. The Department of Tourism took over the project in 2007. The construction
        was completed in 2015.
