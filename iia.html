        The Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo. 6. c. 30) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that
        partitioned British India into the two new independent dominions of India and Pakistan. The Act received Royal
        Assent on 18 July 1947 and thus modern-day India and Pakistan, comprising west (modern day Pakistan) and east
        (modern day Bangladesh) regions, came into being on 15 August.
