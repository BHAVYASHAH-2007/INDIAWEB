        Akbar (Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar,[9] 15 October 1542 – 27 October 1605), popularly known as Akbar
        the Great, was the third Mughal emperor, who reigned from 1556 to 1605. Akbar succeeded his father, Humayun,
        under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in the Indian
        subcontinent. He is generally considered one of the greatest emperors in Indian history and led a successful
        campaign to unify the various kingdoms of Hindūstān or India proper.
