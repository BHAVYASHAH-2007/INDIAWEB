            Zoroastrianism has numerous festivals and holy days, all of which are bound to the Zoroastrian calendar. The
            Shahenshahi and Kadmi variants of the calendar do not intercalate leap years and hence the day of the
            Gregorian calendar year on which these days are celebrated shifts ahead with time. The third variant of the
            Zoroastrian calendar, known as either Fasli (in India) or Bastani (in Iran), intercalates according to
            Gregorian calendar rules and thus remains synchronous with the seasons. For details on the differences, see
            Zoroastrian calendar.

            Six irregularly-spaced seasonal festivals, called gahanbars (meaning "proper season"), are celebrated during
            the religious year. The six festivals are additionally associated with the six "primordial creations" of
            Ahura Mazda, otherwise known as the Amesha Spentas, and through them with aspects of creation (the sky, the
            waters, the earth, plant life, animal life, humankind). Due to the peculiarities of the Shahenshahi and
            Kadmi variants of the Zoroastrian calendar, which do not intercalate and are therefore no longer
            synchronized with the seasons, the seasonal festivals are actually celebrated many months in advance.
