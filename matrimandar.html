        The Matrimandir is an edifice of spiritual significance for practitioners of integral yoga in the centre of
        Auroville established by Mirra Alfassa of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. It is called Soul of the City (French: L'âme
        de la ville) and situated in a large open space called Peace. The Mandir was envisioned in late 1965 by
        Auroville's spiritual co-founder, known as The Mother, who marked a lone banyan tree as the heart of the city
        and dreamed of a gleaming sphere rising amid twelve gardens. Its foundation stone was laid at sunrise on her
        93rd birthday, 21 February 1971, and the four supporting pillars were concreted on 17 November 1973, the very
        evening of her passing. After decades of dedicated work by Aurovilians and craftsmen, the Inner Chamber opened
        in 1994 and the iconic gold‑clad sphere was completed in May 2008.

        The Matrimandir, a "Temple of the Mother" was conceived by The Mother of Auroville in late 1965, when she
        designated a lone banyan tree as the city's spiritual center and envisioned a shining sphere rising from twelve
        surrounding gardens. Its foundation stone was laid on 21 February 1971, and excavation of the 14,000 m³
        pit began three weeks later under the combined effort of Aurovilians and hired laborers. Concreting of the four
        supporting pillars was completed exactly at 7:25 pm on 17 November 1973, coinciding with The Mother's final
        passing, after which construction proceeded steadily.[3][4] The Inner Chamber opened to visitors in 1994, and
        the main golden sphere was finished in 2008, while work on the surrounding twelve gardens and peripheral lake
        remains ongoing.

        The Matrimandir took 37 years to build, from laying the foundation stone at sunrise on 21 February 1971
        Alfassa's 93rd birthday to its completion in May 2008. It is in the form of a huge sphere surrounded by twelve
        petals. Golden discs cover the geodesic dome and reflect sunlight, which gives the structure its characteristic
        radiance. Inside the central dome is a meditation hall known as the inner chamber. This contains the largest
        optically perfect glass globe in the world. The Matrimandir and its surrounding gardens in the central "Peace
        area" are open to the public by appointment.
