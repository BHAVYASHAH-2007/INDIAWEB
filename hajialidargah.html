        The Haji Ali Dargah is a Sufi shrine, and the monument of Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, that is located on an
        islet off the coast of Worli in southern Mumbai, in the state of Maharashtra, India.

        An exquisite example of Indo-Islamic architecture, associated with legends about doomed lovers, the dargah
        contains the tomb of Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. Bukhari was a Sufi saint and a wealthy merchant from Uzbekistan.
        Near the heart of the city proper, the dargah is one of the most recognisable landmarks of Mumbai.

        The Haji Ali Dargah was constructed in 1431 in memory of a wealthy Muslim merchant, Sayyed Pir Haji Ali
        Shah Bukhari, a member of the Chishti Order, who gave up all his worldly possessions before making a
        pilgrimage to Mecca. Hailing from Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan, Bukhari travelled around the world in
        the early to mid 15th century, and eventually settled in present-day Mumbai.
