        Somnath Temple is a Hindu temple, located in Prabhas Patan, Veraval in Gujarat, India. It is one of the most
        sacred pilgrimage sites the Tirtha Kshetra for Hindus and is the first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines
        of Shiva. It is unclear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built, with estimates varying
        between the early centuries of the 1st millennium and about the 9th century CE. Various texts,
        including the Mahabharata and Bhagavata Purana, mention a tirtha (pilgrimage site) at Prabhas Patan on the
        coastline of Saurashtra, where the later temple was, but archaeology has not found traces of an early
        temple, though there was a settlement there.

        In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, historians and archaeologists of the colonial era actively
        studied the Somnath temple because its ruins showed a historic Hindu temple that was turning into an Islamic
        mosque.After India's independence, those ruins were demolished, and the present Somnath temple was
        reconstructed in the MƒÅru-Gurjara style of Hindu temple architecture. The contemporary Somnath temple's
        reconstruction was started under the orders of the first Deputy Prime Minister of India, Vallabhbhai Patel.
        The reconstruction was completed in May 1951.
