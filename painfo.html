            <p>
                Pateti is derived from the word "Patet," meaning repentance. Zoroastrians use this day to reflect on
                their actions and seek forgiveness for any wrongdoings, bad thoughts, words, or deeds.

            <p>
                Parsis visit fire temples (Agiaries) to offer prayers and seek blessings. The sacred fire, representing
                God, is central to Zoroastrian worship.

                <p>
                    While Pateti is a day of introspection, it's also a time for celebration. Parsis wear new clothes,
                    decorate their homes with flowers and rangolis, and prepare traditional Parsi dishes.
