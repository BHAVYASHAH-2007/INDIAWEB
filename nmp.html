        The ‘lake palace’ of Tripura, Neer-Mahal was constructed as a summer residence of the royal family. Maharaja Bir
        Bikram Kishore Manikya Debbarma, of the‘Manikya Dynasty’, which is supposed to be the second longest remaining
        dynasty in the world today, built this palace in 1921.
        <br><br>
        In 1921, the Maharaja commissioned the British company, Martin and Burns to build a unique water palace in the
        middle of Lake Rudrasagar. The lake palace was designed and built on detailed instructions from the Maharaja
        himself and blended Hindu and Mughal architectural styles. Marble and sandstone were used extensively and even
        today, the stand-out is the profusion of balconies, towers, pavilions and bridges. The dome- shaped minars that
        can be seen from far, also give the Neer Mahal a fort-like appearance. The palace is said to have taken nine
        years to build.

        Neermahal also known as Twijilikma Nuyung (lit. 'Water Palace') is a former royal palace of Tripura Kingdom,
        built by Maharaja Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya bahadur in 1930. It is also the largest water palace in India.
        The palace is situated in the middle of Rudrasagar Lake ( Twijilikma ), in Melaghar 53 kilometers away from
        Agartala, the capital of Tripura.
