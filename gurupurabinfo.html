        Guru Nanak Dev Ji was born in 1469 in Rai-Bhoi-di Talwandi (now Nankana Sahib, Pakistan). His life and teachings
        laid the foundation for the Sikh religion and its core principles. He emphasized the importance of:

            <li>
                <h4><b>Naam Japna:</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Remembering and meditating on God's name.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><b>Kirat Karni:</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Earning an honest living through hard work.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><b>Vand Chakna:</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Sharing with others and practicing selfless service.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><b>Equality:</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Guru Nanak rejected the caste system and societal hierarchies, promoting the concept of Langar, a
                    community kitchen where everyone eats together regardless of background.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4><b>One God:</b></h4>
                <p>
                    He preached the oneness of God and the idea that there is no difference between Hindu and Muslim.
                </p>

        Gurpurab celebrations typically begin with Prabhat Pheris, early morning processions in which devotees sing
        hymns, followed by processions through the streets. Gurdwaras (Sikh temples) are beautifully decorated and
        illuminated, and Akhand Path (continuous recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib) is performed. A highlight of the
        day is the Langar, where free meals are served to all, embodying the spirit of service and equality. The day
        concludes with kirtans (devotional hymns) and prayers, reinforcing the message of unity, peace, and love.

    <font color="darkblue" face="arial" size="5">
        Gurpurab is not just a religious festival; it's a celebration of Guru Nanak's message of universal brotherhood,
        social justice, and spiritual enlightenment. It serves as a reminder of the importance of living a life of
        compassion, humility, and service, principles that are still relevant in today's world. The festival is also an
        opportunity for Sikhs to reaffirm their faith and commitment to the teachings of their Guru.
