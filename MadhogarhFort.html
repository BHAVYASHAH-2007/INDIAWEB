        Madhogarh founded by Madho Singh I in the first half of the 18th century, when he placed the area under the
        control of Balwant Singh. The fort is named after Madho Singh I; "Madhogarh" literally means "the fort of
        Madho". Around 1755, this area passed from the Rajputs to the Maratha Empire under Maharaja Khande Rao Holkar of
        Indore when he attacked the independent Mughal chieftain Ismail Beg, Ismail Beg escaped to Madhogarh and
        established a post near Madhogarh fort. Khande Rao Holkar attacked Madhogargh fort and captured it on 16
        February 1792. Ismail Beg escaped and attacked Kanud when the ruling wife of already deceased Nawab Najaf Quli
        Khan had died. Khande Rao Holkar then attacked Kanud and captured Ismail Beg, imprisoned him at Agra Fort and
        put him to death in 1794.Maratha Maharaj Mahadaji Shinde (Scindia) of Gwalior had conquered Rania, Fatehabad
        and Sirsa from governor of Hissar. Haryana came under Maratha Empire. Mahad Ji divided Haryana in four
        territories: Delhi (Mughal emperor Shah Alam II, his family and areas surrounding Delhi), Panipat (Karnal,
        Sonepat, Kurukshetra and Ambala), Hisar (Hisar, Sirsa, Fatehabad, parts of Rohtak), Ahirwal (Gurugram, Rewari,
        Narnaul, Mahendragarh) and Mewat. Daulat Rao Scindia ceded Haryana on 30 December 1803 under the Treaty of
        Surji-Anjangaon to British East India Company's Company rule in India. It is very important from the point of
        view of tourism, it would be better to go here during the time of rain and winter, it is also called "Mini
        Musuri" of local area during foggy session. According to the information received from the bujurg people, this
        fort was built in 16-17 AD and Swai Madho Singh built it for take rest between Jaipur and Delhi, and the village
        was named Madhogadh in his name. At that time, Madhogarh trade point between Delhi and Jaipur was strong. There
        are still many havelis of Baniyas (Business men) built below the hill. In which the film also shot titled
        "Jalpari".

        Among the numerous forts spread across Haryana, only very few are hill forts. The Madogarh Fort is among those
        few hill forts of Haryana, hence special. Surrounded by the protective rampart, the fort has a palace, a
        garrison building and a step well. The Madhogarh Palace Car Park inside the fort, in fort of the palace, is
        reachable by a motorable black-topped road which is 2.6 km from Madhogarh village's bus stop.

        The rampart is several meter high and it is built along the highest ridge line of the hill. It is made of stone
        masonry using the in-situ available stones. The rampart has a few feet high continuous parapet on top on the
        outward facing side of the rampart. There are several observation guard towers along the length of the rampart.

        The Madhogarh Palace is a several story high building, with a 2-story high gateway as the main entrance.

        The Madhogarh Garrison-cum-storage building is a large square-shaped ruined structure 50 m ariel distance
        northwest of the palace. It is accessible from the car park in front of the palace, via a 150 meter foot track
        running along the northern side of the palace.

        The Madhogarh Step Well, built as the main water supply for the fort, is dependent on the rain water harvesting.
        The step well has a ghat, i.e. flight of stairs, leading down to the water. The rampart begins on the western
        corner of the stepwell. The step well is approximate 100 m ariel distance west of the palace, it is reachable by
        a 100 m foot track which begins 100 meter before the palace off the left or western side of the motorable road
        going to the palace.

        The Madhogarh Ropeway and the Madhogarh Glass Bridge Skywalk are also planned. See also Ropeway s in India and
        Glass Bridge Skywalk in India.
