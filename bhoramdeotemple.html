        The Bhoramdeo Temple, an 11th-century architectural marvel dedicated to Lord Shiva, is a significant religious
        and historical site in Chhattisgarh, India. Often called the "Khajuraho of Chhattisgarh," it's renowned for its
        intricate carvings and similarities to the Khajuraho and Konark temples. The temple's unique style blends
        elements of the Nagara and Dravidian architectural styles, showcasing a harmonious synthesis of various regional
        influences.

        The Bhoramdeo temple complex is situated in the Kabirdham district of Chhattisgarh. The complex consists of the
        Bhoramdeo temple, a dilapidated structure, site museum and dislodged sculptures- mostly hero-stones aligned
        around its circumference. The site is a popular tourist and pilgrimage centre because of its antiquity and
        evolved architecture. The temple stands in close proximity to the Cherki and Mandwa Mahal and the relationship
        between the three is little known.
        <br><br>
        The main structure, Bhoramdeo, is dated to the 11-12th centuries in the reign of a Naga king who perhaps, also
        patronised the Cherki and Madwa Mahal. The sculpture of a male with an inscription on its pedestal, often
        recognised as a 'yogi' placed inside the mandapa of Bhoramdeo records the name of a Naga king Gopaladev and
        dates it to the 11th century (1098 CE).
