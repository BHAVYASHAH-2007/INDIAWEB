        Rani Ki Vav (lit. 'The Queen's Stepwell') is a stepwell situated in the town of Patan in Gujarat, India. It is
        located on the banks of the Saraswati River. Its construction is attributed to Udayamati, the spouse of the
        11th-century Chaulukya king Bhima I. Silted over, it was rediscovered in the 1940s and restored in the 1980s by
        the Archaeological Survey of India. It has been listed as one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India since
        2014. The stepwell is designed as an underground shrine or inverted temple; representing the sanctity of water,
        with the sculptures in the stepwell depicting numerous Hindu deities. It is divided into seven levels of stairs
        with sculptural panels. These panels have more than 500 principal sculptures and over a thousand minor ones that
        combine religious, secular and symbolic imagery.

        Rani ni Vav was constructed during the rule of the Chaulukya dynasty. It is located on the banks of Saraswati
        river.[1] The city was sacked by Sultan of Delhi Qutb-ud-din Aibak between 1200 and 1210, and again by Allauddin
        Khilji in 1298.

        Prabandha-Chintamani, composed by the Jain monk Merutunga in 1304, mentions: "Udayamati, the daughter of
        Naravaraha Khengara, built this novel stepwell at Shripattana (Patan) surpassing the glory of the Sahasralinga
        Tank". According to it, the stepwell was commissioned in 1063 and was completed after 20 years. It is generally
        assumed that it was built in the memory of Bhima I (r. c. 1022 – 1064) by his queen Udayamati and probably
        completed by Udayamati and Karna after his death but whether she was a widow when she commissioned it is
        disputed. Commissariat puts the date of construction to 1032 based on the architectural similarity to
        Vimalavasahi temple on Mount Abu built in the same year.
