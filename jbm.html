        The Jallianwala Bagh massacre (IPA: [dʒəlɪjãːʋaːlaː baːɣ, baːɡ]), also known as the Amritsar massacre, took
        place on 13 April 1919. A large crowd had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab, British India,
        during the annual Baisakhi fair to protest against the Rowlatt Act and the arrest of pro-Indian independence
        activists Saifuddin Kitchlew and Satyapal. In response to the public gathering, the temporary brigadier general
        R. E. H. Dyer surrounded the people with his Gurkha and Sikh infantry regiments of the British Indian
        Army. The Jallianwala Bagh could only be exited on one side, as its other three sides were enclosed by
        buildings. After blocking the exit with his troops, Dyer ordered them to shoot at the crowd, continuing to fire
        even as the protestors tried to flee. The troops kept on firing until their ammunition was low and they were
        ordered to stop. Estimates of those killed vary from 379 to 1,500 or more people; over 1,200 others
        were injured, of whom 192 sustained serious injury. Britain has never formally apologised for the
        massacre but expressed "deep regret" in 2019.
