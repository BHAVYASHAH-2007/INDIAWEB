        The Dilwara Temples or Delvada Temples are a group of Śvētāmbara Jain temples located about 2+1⁄2 kilometres
        from the Mount Abu settlement in Sirohi District, Rajasthan's only hill station. The earliest were built by
        Vimal Shah , a Jain minister of Solanki king of Gurjaratra , Bhima I and additions to the temples were made
        by Vastupala, Jain minister of Vaghelas of Gurjaratra. They date between the 11th and 16th centuries,
        forming some of the most famous monuments in the style of Solanki architecture, famous for their use of a
        very pure white marble and intricate marble carvings. They are managed by Seth Shri Kalyanji Anandji
        Pedhi, Sirohi and are a pilgrimage place for Jains, and a significant general tourist attraction. The
        Dilwara temples are regarded as the most impressive among Jain temples in Rajasthan.

        The five Dilwara temples are among the most famous Jain temples. The Vimal Vasahi is much the earliest,
        constructed by 1031, with the Luna Vasahi by 1230, and the others at intervals between 1459 and 1582. All
        are in white marble which adds greatly to their effect and remains in use. The oldest and largest two have
        large amounts of intricate carving even by the standards of the style, reaching a peak in the Luna Vasahi
        temple. The main buildings of the first three named are surrounded by "cloister" screens of devakulikā
        shrines, and are fairly plain on the outer walls of these; in the case of the Vimal Vasahi this screen was a
        later addition, around the time of the second temple. These three have an axis from the sanctuary through a
        closed, then an open mandapa to an open rangamandapa, or larger hall for dance or drama. Surrounding the
        main temple with a curtain of shrines was to become a distinctive feature of the Jain temples of West India,
        still employed in some modern temples.
