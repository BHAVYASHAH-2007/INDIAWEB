        The Battle of Plassey was a decisive victory of the British East India Company, under the leadership of Robert
        Clive, over the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies on 23 June 1757. The victory was made possible by the
        defection of Mir Jafar, Nawab Siraj-ud-Daulah's commander in chief, as well as much of the Bengal Subah's armies
        being earlier committed against an Afghan invasion led by Ahmad Shah Durrani against the Mughal Empire. The
        battle helped the British East India Company take control of Bengal in 1772. Over the next hundred years, they
        continued to expand their control over vast territories in the rest of the Indian subcontinent and Burma.
