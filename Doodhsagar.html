        Dudhsagar Falls (lit. 'Sea of Milk') is a four-tiered waterfall on the Mahadayi River in the state of Goa. It is
        60km from Panaji by road and is located on the Belagavi–Vasco Da Gama rail route about 46km east of Madgaon and
        80km south of Belagavi . Dudhsagar Falls is perched at the top of a crescent shaped valley and surrounded by
        pristine forests, and it is amongst India's tallest waterfalls with a height of 310 m (1017 feet) and an average
        width of 30 metres (100 feet).
        <br><br>
        The falls are located in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park among the Western Ghats. The
        falls are a punctuation mark in the journey of the Mandovi River from the Western Ghats to Panjim where it meets
        the Arabian sea. The area is surrounded by deciduous forests with rich biodiversity.
        <br><br>
        There are two routes to reach the falls. One is starting the trek from Kulem and following the jeep trail until
        the bottom of the waterfall. The second option is via the railway track which is roughly around 11 km. This trek
        is not allowed by the Government of Goa (Forest Department) as it is very risky being on a railway track with
        minimum safety. Anyone trekking along the Railway trek can be heavily fined and can even land you in jail.
