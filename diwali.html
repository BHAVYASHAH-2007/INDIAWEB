        Diwali English: also called Deepavali or Deepawali , is the
        Hindu festival of lights, with variations celebrated in other Indian religions such as Jainism and Sikhism.
        It symbolises the spiritual victory of Dharma over Adharma, light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge
        over ignorance. Diwali is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the
        amanta tradition) and Kārtika—between around mid-September and mid-November. The celebrations
        generally last five or six days.

        Diwali is connected to various religious events, deities and personalities, such as being the day Rama returned
        to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon king
        Ravana. It is also widely associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha, the god of wisdom
        and the remover of obstacles.[17] Other regional traditions connect the holiday to Vishnu, Krishna, Durga,
        Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman.
