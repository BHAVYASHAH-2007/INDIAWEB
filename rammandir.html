        The site of the temple has been the subject of communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in India, as it
        is
        the former location of the Babri Masjid, which was built between 1528 and 1529. Idols of Rama and Sita were
        placed in the mosque in 1949, before it was attacked and demolished in 1992. In 2019, the Supreme
        Court of India delivered the verdict to give the disputed land to Hindus for construction of a temple, while
        Muslims were given land nearby in Dhannipur in Ayodhya to construct a mosque. The court referenced a report
        from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as evidence suggesting the presence of a structure beneath the
        demolished Babri Masjid, that was found to be non-Islamic.

        On 5 August 2020, the bhūmi pūjana (transl. ground breaking ceremony) for the commencement of the
        construction of Ram Mandir was performed by Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of India. The temple complex,
        currently under construction, is being supervised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust. On 22
        January 2024, Modi served as the Mukhya Yajamāna (transl. chief patron) of rituals for the event and
        performed the prāṇa pratiṣṭhā (transl. consecration) of the temple. The prana pratishtha ceremony
        was organised by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra. The temple has also attracted a number of
        controversies due to alleged misuse of donation, sidelining of its major activists, and politicisation of
        the temple by the Bharatiya Janata Party.
