        Nowruz's origins trace back over 3,000 years to ancient Persia and the Zoroastrian tradition. It was originally
        a sacred occasion marking the vernal equinox, the moment when the sun crosses the equator, and day and night are
        of equal length. Over time, Nowruz evolved from a purely religious observance into a secular festival, embracing
        diverse communities and cultures.

            <p>
                A central feature of Nowruz is the Haft-Seen table, a symbolic arrangement of seven items (though
                sometimes more) that all start with the Persian letter "S" (or "Shin"). Each item represents a different
                aspect of life, such as growth (Sabzeh – sprouts), health (Seer – garlic), prosperity (Samanu – sweet
                wheat pudding), and so on.

        Nowruz is more than just a New Year celebration; it's a powerful symbol of renewal, hope, and the enduring human
        spirit. It signifies the triumph of light over darkness, the arrival of spring after winter's slumber, and the
        promise of new beginnings in all aspects of life. The festival fosters a sense of unity and shared identity
        among diverse communities, promoting cultural exchange and understanding. UNESCO recognized Nowruz as an
        Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2009, further highlighting its importance in preserving and promoting cultural
        diversity.
