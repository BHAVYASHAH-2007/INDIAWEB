        The Quit India Movement was a movement launched at the Bombay session of the All India Congress Committee by
        Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942, during World War II, demanding an end to British rule in India.

        After the British failed to secure Indian support for the British war effort with the Cripps Mission, Gandhi
        made a call to Do or Die in his Quit India speech delivered in Bombay on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank
        Maidan. Viceroy Linlithgow described the movement as "by far the most serious rebellion since 1857".
