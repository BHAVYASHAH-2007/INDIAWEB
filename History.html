        Chandragupta Maurya overthrew the Nanda Empire and established the first great empire in ancient India, the
        Maurya
        Empire. India's Mauryan king Ashoka is widely recognised for the violent kalinga war and his historical
        acceptance
        of Buddhism and his attempts to spread nonviolence and peace across his empire. The Maurya Empire would collapse
        in
        185 BCE, on the assassination of the then-emperor Brihadratha by his general Pushyamitra Shunga. Shunga would
        form
        the Shunga Empire in the north and north-east of the subcontinent, while the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom would claim
        the
        north-west and found the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Various parts of India were ruled by numerous dynasties, including
        the
        Gupta Empire, in the 4th to 6th centuries CE. This period, witnessing a Hindu religious and intellectual
        resurgence
        is known as the Classical or Golden Age of India. Aspects of Indian civilisation, administration, culture, and
        religion spread to much of Asia, which led to the establishment of Indianised kingdoms in the region, forming
        Greater India.The most significant event between the 7th and 11th centuries was the Tripartite struggle
        centred on Kannauj. Southern India saw the rise of multiple imperial powers from the middle of the fifth
        century.
        The Chola dynasty conquered southern India in the 11th century. In the early medieval period, Indian
        mathematics,
        including Hindu numerals, influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Arab world, including
        the
        creation of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system.

        Islamic conquests made limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Sindh as early as the 8th century,followed by
        the invasions of Mahmud Ghazni.The Delhi Sultanate, established in 1206 by Central Asian Turks, ruled much of
        northern India in the 14th century. It was governed by various Turkic and Afghan dynasties, including the
        Indo-Turkic Tughlaqs.The empire declined in the late 14th century following the invasions of Timur and
        saw the advent of the Malwa, Gujarat, and Bahmani sultanates, the last of which split in 1518 into the five
        Deccan
        sultanates. The wealthy Bengal Sultanate also emerged as a major power, lasting over three centuries.During
        this period, multiple strong Hindu kingdoms, notably the Vijayanagara Empire and Rajput states under the Kingdom
        of
        Mewar emerged and played significant roles in shaping the cultural and political landscape of India.

        The early modern period began in the 16th century, when the Mughal Empire conquered most of the Indian
        subcontinent,signaling the proto-industrialisation, becoming the biggest global economy and manufacturing
        power.The Mughals suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, largely due to the rising power
        of the Marathas, who took control of extensive regions of the Indian subcontinent, and numerous Afghan
        invasions.The East India Company, acting as a sovereign force on behalf of the British government,
        gradually acquired control of huge areas of India between the middle of the 18th and the middle of the 19th
        centuries. Policies of company rule in India led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. India was afterwards ruled
        directly by the British Crown, in the British Raj. After World War I, a nationwide struggle for independence was
        launched by the Indian National Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, the All-India Muslim League would
        advocate
        for a separate Muslim-majority nation state. The British Indian Empire was partitioned in August 1947 into the
        Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan, each gaining its independence.
