        Nalanda University, an ancient center of Buddhist learning, was a renowned monastic university in ancient India,
        located in the present-day state of Bihar. It flourished for over 700 years, from the 5th century CE to the 12th
        century CE, attracting scholars and students from across Asia. The university is celebrated for its
        contributions to
        Buddhist philosophy, logic, and medicine, and its legacy continues to inspire educational institutions
        worldwide.

        Situated besides the Rajgir hills, the rejuvenated Nalanda University calls-out “Learning is being here.” The
        experience of being in this intellectual landscape is empowering with its seamless co-existence between nature
        and man, and between living and learning. The region vibrates with the positivity endowed by spiritual divines
        like Lord Buddha, Lord Mahavira who meditated in this region and with the scholarly traditions developed by
        great masters such as Nagarjuna, Aryabhatta, Dharmakirti who discoursed at the ancient Nalanda. Ancient Magadha
        was characterized by an intellectual ferment rarely known to humanity. The opportunity to comprehend multiple
        discourses and embrace knowledge in its entirety is what made Nalanda academics unique and attractive for all
        seekers.

        The first residential university of the world founded at Nalanda by the magnanimity of Emperor Kumaragupta in
        427CE and sustained by the conscientiousness of the learned monks and teachers, flourished for over 800 years
        till the end in 12th century CE. It is believed to possess 2,000 teachers and 10,000 students. Nalanda had
        attracted scholars to its campus from places as distant as China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and
        South East Asia. Those scholars have left records about the ambience, architecture, and learning at Nalanda, as
        well as, about the profound knowledge of Nalanda teachers. The most detailed accounts have come from Chinese
        scholars and the best known of these is Xuan Zang, who carried back many hundred scriptures which were later
        translated into Chinese.
