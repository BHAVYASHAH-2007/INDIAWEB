        Anandpur Sahib, also referred simply as Anandpur (lit. 'city of bliss'), is a city in Rupnagar district
        (Ropar), on the edge of Shivalik Hills, in the Indian state of Punjab.[1] Located near the Sutlej River, the
        city is one of the most sacred religious places in Sikhism, being the place where the last two Sikh Gurus,
        Guru Tegh Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh, lived. It is also the place where Guru Gobind Singh founded the
        Khalsa Panth in 1699. The city is home to Takhat Sri Kesgarh Sahib, the third of the five Takhts in
        Sikhism.

        Anandpur Sahib was founded in June 1665 by the ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur. Gurinder Singh Mann
        states that Guru Tegh Bahadur established Anandpur in 1684. He previously lived in Kiratpur, but given
        the disputes with Ram Rai – the elder son of Guru Har Rai and other sects of Sikhism, he moved to village in
        Makhoval. He named it Chakk Nanaki after his mother. In 1675, Guru Tegh Bahadur was tortured and beheaded
        for refusing to convert to Islam under the orders of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, a martyrdom that led
        Sikhs to rename the town to Anandpur and crown his son Gobind Das as per his orders (also known as Gobind
        Rai) as his successor and famous as Guru Gobind Singh.
