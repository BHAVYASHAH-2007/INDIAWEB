        Diwali's core message revolves around the victory of good over evil, light over darkness, and knowledge over
        ignorance. This theme is rooted in various Hindu mythological stories, the most prominent being the return of
        Lord Rama to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile, vanquishing the demon king Ravana. The festival signifies new
        beginnings, hope, and the dispelling of negativity.
