            Vaisakhi (Sanskrit:, also known as Baisakhi) or Mesadi or Basoa , marks the first day of the month of
            Vaisakh and is traditionally celebrated annually on 13
            April or sometimes 14 April. It is seen as a spring harvest celebration primarily in Punjab and
            Northern India. Whilst it is culturally significant in many parts of India as a festival
            of harvest, Vaisakhi is also the date for the Indian Solar New Year. However, Sikhs celebrate the new year
            on the first the month Chet, according to the Nanakshahi calendar.

            Historically, the festival of Vaisakhi was north Indiaâ€™s most important annual market.Although Vaisakhi
            began as a grain harvest festival for Hindus and its observance predates the creation of Sikhism, it gained
            historical association with the Sikhs following the inauguration of the Khalsa.
