            Al-Muharram (Arabic: ٱلْمُحَرَّم, romanized: al-Muḥarram) is the first month of the Islamic calendar. It is
            one of the four sacred months of the year when warfare is banned. It precedes the month of Safar.

            The tenth of Muharram is known as Ashura, an important day of commemoration in Islam. For Sunni Muslims, the
            day marks the parting of the Red Sea by Moses and the salvation of the Israelites, celebrated through
            supererogatory fasting and other acceptable expressions of joy. By contrast, Ashura is a day of mourning for
            Shia Muslims, who annually commemorate the death of Husayn ibn Ali, grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad
            and the third Shia imam. Husayn was killed, alongside most of his relatives and his small retinue, in the
            Battle of Karbala in 680 CE against the army of the Umayyad caliph Yazid I (r. 680–683). The Shia rituals
            span the first ten days of Muharram, culminating on Ashura with mourning processions in Shia cities. Also in
            Muharram, the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem was initially set as the direction of prayer for early Muslims.
