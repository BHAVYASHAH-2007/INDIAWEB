        A houseboat is a boat that has been designed or modified to be used primarily for regular dwelling. Most
        houseboats are not motorized, as they are usually moored or kept stationary, fixed at a berth, and often
        tethered to land to provide utilities. However, many are capable of operation under their own power.
        <br><br>
        Houseboats are largely found on small inland rivers, lakes, and streams, and in coastal harbours, especially
        where there is good fishing, in many countries.

        There are a few houseboat options in South Africa, including self-drive houseboats on the Knysna Lagoon and
        fully catered houseboats on Lake Jozini. There have been a number of serious incidents with houseboat fires in
        the country. On 19 November 2016, four people died on Hartbeespoort Dam after a fire broke on a party houseboat.
        On 9 October 2021, a faulty engine set luxury houseboat Shayamanzi afire and led to the death of two crew
        members and a German tourist.
