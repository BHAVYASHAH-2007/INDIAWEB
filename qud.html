        Qutb-ud-din Mubarak Shah I (r. 1316–1320) also known as Bakhtiyar al-Din, was a ruler of the Delhi Sultanate
        of present-day India. A member of the Khalji dynasty, he was a son of Alauddin Khalji.After Alauddin's death,
        Mubarak Shah was imprisoned by Malik Kafur, who appointed his younger brother Shihabuddin Omar as a puppet
        monarch. After Malik Kafur's murder, Mubarak Shah became the regent. Soon after, he blinded his brother, and
        usurped the power. After ascending the throne, he resorted to populist measures, such as abolishing the heavy
        taxes and penalties imposed by his father, and releasing thousands of prisoners.
