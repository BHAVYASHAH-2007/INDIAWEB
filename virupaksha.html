        Virupaksha Temple (ʋɪruːpaː'kʂɐ) is located in Hampi in the Vijayanagara district of Karnataka, India, situated
        on the banks of the river Tungabhadra, a 7th-century temple of Lord Shiva. It is part of the Group of Monuments
        at Hampi, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temple is dedicated to Sri Virupaksha. The temple was
        expanded by Lakkan Dandesha, a nayaka (chieftain) under the ruler Deva Raya II, also known as Prauda Deva Raya
        of the Vijayanagara Empire.

        Hampi, capital of the Vijayanagar empire, sits on the banks of the Tungabhadra River (Pampa hole/Pampa river).
        Virupaksha Temple is the main center of pilgrimage (ತೀರ್ಥಯಾತ್ರೆ) at Hampi, and has been considered the most
        sacred sanctuary over the centuries. It is intact among the surrounding ruins and is still used in worship. The
        temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, known here as Virupaksha/Pampa pathi, as the consort of the local goddess
        Pampadevi who is associated with the Tungabhadra River. There is also a Virupakshini Amma temple (mother
        goddess) in a village called Nalagamapalle, Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh, approximately 100 km from
        Tirupati.

        The temple's history is uninterrupted from about the 7th century CE. The Virupaksha-Pampa sanctuary existed well
        before the Vijayanagara capital was located here. Inscriptions referring to Shiva date back to the 9th and 10th
        centuries. What started as a small shrine grew into a large complex under the Vijayanagara rulers. Evidence
        indicates there were additions made to the temple in the late Chalukyan and Hoysala periods, though most of the
        temple buildings are attributed to the Vijayanagara period. The huge temple complex was built by Lakkana
        Dandesha, a chieftain under king Deva Raya II of the Vijayanagara Empire.
