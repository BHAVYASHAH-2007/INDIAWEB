        Civil disobedience is the active and professed refusal of a citizen to obey certain laws, demands, orders, or
        commands of a government (or any other authority). By some definitions, civil disobedience has to be nonviolent
        to be called "civil". Hence, civil disobedience is sometimes equated with peaceful protests or nonviolent
        resistance. Henry David Thoreau's essay Resistance to Civil Government, first published in 1849 and then
        published posthumously in 1866 as Civil Disobedience, popularized the term in the US, although the concept
        itself was practiced long before this work.
