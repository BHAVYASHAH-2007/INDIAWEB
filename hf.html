        The pure Tamil name of Hogenakkal Falls is Uguneer Kal (உகுநீர் கல்). It was under the rule of Mysore
        Kingdom from 1652 to 1768 and during that period many Kannadigas were employed and settled here in large numbers
        for tax collection work. Due to this reason, many Tamil names there became Kannada names.That is how Uguneer
        Kal(உகுநீர் கல்) became Hogenakkal. The name Hogenakal is derived from Kannada means ‘Smoky Rocks’. The river
        when falls on the rock below, the gushing force of water resembles like smoke emanating from the rocks.It
        is also called as Marikottayam by the people of Tamil Nadu.

        Hogenakkal falls is mentioned in Sangam Literature as Thalaineer aruvi (தலைநீர் அருவி). All the areas around
        this waterfalls are called Thalaineer Naadu (தலைநீர் நாடு). It was ruled by the King named Adiyaman Neduman
        Anji. References to this King and the Falls are found in the Sangam Literatures like Purananooru (புறநானூறு),
        Agananooru (அகநானூறு), Kurunthogai (குறுந்தொகை) etc.
