        Maneckji Seth Agiary is the second-oldest Zoroastrian fire temple (or agiary, Gujarati for "house of fire")
        in Mumbai, India, constructed in 1735.[1] Banaji Limji Agiary, established in 1709, is the oldest. As in
        all Zoroastrian temples, non-Parsis are not allowed to enter. The architecture of the building is a mix of
        Persian and Greek Revival styles, with two lamassus standing guard at the temple entrance.
