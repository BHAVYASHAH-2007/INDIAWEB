        Holi festivities typically last for two days. The first day, known as Holika Dahan, involves a bonfire,
        commemorating the story of Holika and Prahlad, where Holika's attempt to harm Prahlad through fire failed,
        signifying the triumph of good. The second day is dedicated to playing with colors, where people smear each
        other
        with vibrant gulal (dry colors) and engage in water fights with pichkaris (water guns).

        Beyond the playful nature of the celebrations, Holi holds deep cultural and religious significance. It is a time
        for forgiveness, reconciliation, and strengthening bonds with family and friends. The colors used in Holi
        symbolize the diverse tapestry of humanity, reminding people that despite their differences, they are united in
        love and joy.
