        The sarovar (holy pool) on the site of the gurdwara was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das, in
        1577.In 1604, Guru Arjan, the fifth Sikh Guru, placed a copy of the Adi Granth in the Golden Temple
        and was a prominent figure in its development. The gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after
        it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan
        armies. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in
        1809, and overlaid the sanctum with gold leaf in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple.

        The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a centre of the Singh
        Sabha Movement between 1883 and the 1920s, and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early
        1980s, the gurdwara became a centre of conflict between the Indian government and a radical movement led by
        Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. In 1984, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of
        Operation Blue Star, leading to the deaths of thousands of soldiers, militants and civilians, as well as
        causing significant damage to the gurdwara and the destruction of the nearby Akal Takht. The gurdwara
        complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 attack on it.
