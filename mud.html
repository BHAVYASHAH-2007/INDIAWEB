        Muhammad bin Tughluq (Persian: محمد بن تغلق; Persian pronunciation: [mu.ham.ˈmad bin tuɣ.ˈlaq]; 1290 – 20 March
        1351), or Muhammad II, also known by his epithets, The Eccentric Prince, and The Mad Sultan, was the
        eighteenth Sultan of Delhi. He reigned from February 1325 until his death in March 1351. The sultan was the
        eldest son of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, founder of the Tughlaq dynasty. In 1321, the young Muhammad was sent by
        his father to the Deccan Plateau to fight a military campaign against the Kakatiya dynasty. In 1323, the future
        sultan successfully laid siege upon the Kakatiya capital in Warangal. This victory over King Prataparudra ended
        the Kakatiya dynasty.
