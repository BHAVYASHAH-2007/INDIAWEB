            Paryushana is an annual holy event in Jainism and is usually celebrated in August, September or October in
            the Hindi calendar month of Bhadrapad's Shukla Paksha. Jains increase their level of spiritual intensity
            often using fasting and prayer/meditation to help. The five main vows are emphasized during this
            time.[citation needed] There are no set rules and followers are encouraged to practice according to their
            abilities and desires. The event lasts for 8 days and ends with the celebration of Samvatsari (forgiveness
            day).

            At the conclusion of the festival, followers request forgiveness from others for any offenses committed
            during the preceding year. Forgiveness is asked by saying "Micchami Dukkadam" to others. This translates to:
            "If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or action, then I seek your
            forgiveness."
