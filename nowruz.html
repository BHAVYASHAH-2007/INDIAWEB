            Nowruz (Persian: نوروز, Iranian Persian: [noɾuz],[x] lit.'New Day') is the Iranian or Persian New
            Year. Historically, it has been observed by Iranian peoples,but is now celebrated by many
            ethnicities worldwide. It is a festival based on the Northern Hemisphere spring equinox, which marks the
            first day of a new year on the Iranian calendars and the currently used Solar Hijri calendar; it usually
            coincides with a date between 19 March and 22 March on the Gregorian calendar.
