            Eid al-Fitr (Arabic: عيد الفطر, romanized: ʿĪd al-Fiṭr, lit.'Festival of Breaking the Fast') is the
            first of the two main festivals in Islam, the other being Eid al-Adha. It falls on the first day of Shawwal,
            the tenth month of the Islamic calendar.Eid al-Fitr is celebrated by Muslims worldwide because it marks
            the end of the month-long dawn-to-dusk fasting (sawm) of Ramadan. The holiday is known under various
            other names in different languages and countries around the world.

            According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad instituted the celebration of Eid al-Fitr.According to a certain
            hadith, these festivals were initiated in Medina after the migration of Muhammad from Mecca. Anas ibn Malik,
            a companion of Muhammad, narrated that when Muhammad arrived in Medina, he found people celebrating two
            specific days in which they entertained themselves with recreation. Muhammad then remarked that God had
            fixed two mandatory days of festivity: Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.
