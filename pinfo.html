        Paryushan, derived from the Sanskrit word "Pari" (around) and "ushan" (to be ardent or to burn), signifies a
        time of being surrounded by spiritual practices and burning away negative karmas. The festival encourages Jains
        to engage in activities like fasting, meditation, and studying religious texts to purify their souls and minds.
        It's a time for self-reflection, seeking forgiveness for past wrongdoings, and making amends with others.

                    The final day of Paryushan, Samvatsari, is dedicated to collective forgiveness, where Jains express

        Paryushan is not merely a festival of rituals; it's a profound opportunity for spiritual growth and
        self-transformation. It emphasizes the importance of non-violence (Ahimsa), truthfulness (Satya), non-stealing
        (Asteya), celibacy (Brahmacharya), and non-attachment (Aparigraha) â€“ the five core principles of Jainism. By
        engaging in these practices, Jains aim to purify their souls, minimize negative karmic imprints, and move closer
        to liberation (Moksha).

        Paryushan also fosters a sense of community and shared spiritual purpose. The collective energy of Jains
        engaging in similar practices creates a powerful atmosphere conducive to self-improvement and spiritual
        awakening. The festival serves as a reminder of the importance of compassion, forgiveness, and the
        interconnectedness of all living beings.
        <br><br>
        In conclusion, Paryushan is a transformative festival that encourages Jains to embark on a journey of
        self-discovery, purification, and spiritual growth, ultimately contributing to a more ethical and compassionate
        world.
