        The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was a major uprising in India in 1857â€“58 against the rule of the British East India
        Company, which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown. The rebellion began on 10
        May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the company's army in the garrison town of Meerut, 40 miles (64
        km) northeast of Delhi. It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian rebellions chiefly in the upper
        Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred farther north and
        east. The rebellion posed a military threat to British power in that region, and was contained only
        with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858.[10] On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty to all
        rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July
        1859.
