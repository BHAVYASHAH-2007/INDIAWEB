        two main entrances to the fort, and the fort's gates are protected by high walls.It is divided into two parts â€“
        the lower fort and the upper fort. At present, the lower fort houses the main entrance, while the upper fort
        contains temples, a modern statue of Shivaji Maharaj, and several buildings. The fort has several watch towers
        and bastion for providing strategic military advantages during its time of use.
